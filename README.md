To do:
- include pipeline support for emission textures and decals
- add a 3rd UV channel and map to `CUSTOM0`. xy corresponds to `UV3`
- compile demo that includes light baking - this could be a problem since Godot expects UV2 to be free in the light-baking process
- consider GDextension/engine mod to fix light baking issue
